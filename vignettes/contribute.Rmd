    cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rmarkdown.pdf)

* Familiarity with
  - [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org)
  - [BiocStyle](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/BiocStyle.html)

#### Good to Have

* [pandoc](https://pandoc.org)

### Claim a Vignette to Convert

1. Check the
   [Sweave2rmd Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/Bioconductor/projects/2/views/1)
2. Select an issue to work on by setting `Status` to `Todo`, `Last Modified` to
   today, and change `Assigned` to your GitHub username.
3. If the package is not maintained by Bioconductor, you must contact the
   maintainer to verify they will accept a pull request with the converted
   vignette.

### Confirm Willingness of Maintainer to Accept Pull Request

#### Contact the Maintainer via Email

1. Search for the package on
[BiocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html#___Software).  #pv screenshot image here
2. Click on the package name to go to the package's landing page.
3. Find the maintainer's email.
4. Email the maintainer asking if they would accept a pull request with the
   converted vignette. You can modify the following example email to send to
   the maintainer:
   ```
   Hi,

   I'm volunteering with [Sweave2Rmd](https://github.com/Bioconductor/sweave2rmd)
   and we're trying to convert all Bioconductor Sweave vignettes into `.Rmd`
   files. Would you be willing to accept a pull request converting *vignette
   name* for *package name* from one of our volunteers? We'll take care of
   converting the file. We'll ask you to review and accept the pull request.
   You'll also need to bump the version number in your DESCRIPTION file so that
   the build machines will recognize that a new version is available.

   Thanks for your time.
   ```
5. On the project board, set the `Status` to `Contacted` and `Last Modified` to
   today
6. If the maintainer will accept the pull request, set the `Status` to
   `Maintainer Interested`. If they will not accept a pull request, set it to
   `Maintainer Not Interested`. If after two weeks, the maintainer is not
   responsive, set the `Status` to `Unresponsive`.
7. Set `Last Modified` to today.

### Convert the .Rnw vignette to .Rmd

Note: We use `file` to indicate the name of the Sweave file that we will
convert to `.Rmd`.

1. On the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/Bioconductor/projects/2/views/1), set the `Status` to `In Progress`.
2. Search for the package on
   [BiocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html#___Software). #pv screenshot image here
3. Click on the package to visit its landing page.
4. Find the current Sweave file that you will convert. Use this as reference to compare the
   with the `.Rmd` version you will create.
5. Fork the repository you will work on. 
6. Clone your newly forked repository. 
7. Make a branch for your changes: `git switch -c file-Rmd`
8. If you have `pandoc`, use it to preprocess. In the terminal
   1. `cp file.Rnw file.tex`
   2. `pandoc -s file.tex -o file.md`
   3. `mv file.md file.Rmd`
9. If the file doesn't have yaml at the top, add it using the following as an
   example:
  ```
  ---
  title: "Vignette Title"
  author: "Vignette Author" 
  date: r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')
  package: PackageName
  output: 
    BiocStyle::html_document
  vignette: >
    %\VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette Title}
    %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
    %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8} 
  bibliography:
  - cat.bib   
  ---
  ```
10. If `BiocStyle` isn't in the DESCRIPTION file, add it under `Suggests`.
11. In the DESCRIPTION file, convert the Authors section to conform to:

  ```
  ---
Authors@R: c(
    person("First Name", "Last Name", role="aut"),
    person("First Name", "Last Name", role="ctb"),
    person("Your First Name", "Your Last Name", role = "ctb",
        comment = "Converted YOUR_VIGNETTE_NAME vignette from Sweave to RMarkdown / HTML."),
    person("Bioconductor Package Maintainer",
        email = "maintainer@bioconductor.org", role="cre"))
  ---
  ```
12. Remove the `Maintainer` line from the DESCRIPTION file.
13. Convert any lines manually as necessary.
14. If using Rstudio, `Knit` your new vignette and compare with the Sweave
    version.
15. Repeat 10-12 until your new `HTML` vignettes accurately represents the
    Sweave version.
16. Commit your changes with `git commit -m 'Convert file to Rmd'`.
17. Remove the Sweave file with `git rm file.Rnw`
18. Commit your change with `git commit -m 'Remove file.Rnw'`.
19. Push your branch with `git push origin file-rmd`.
20. On github.com, go to your forked repository and create a pull request.
21 In the comments of the pull request, ask for a review with
    `@Bioconductor/sweave2rmd` and attach the `HTML` vignette.
22. On the project board, set the `Status` to `PR Made`.
23. If your reviewer leaves any comments, address them until your pull request
    is ready to merge.

### Review a Pull Request

When reviewing a pull request, confirm

* the `HTML` document is representative of the Sweave document
* the `.Rmd` file is representative of the Sweave document
* the `.Rmd` file uses best practices

Use the comments to communicate issues to resolve for the volunteer who made
the pull request.

When all issues are resolved, ask the maintainer to approve the pull request
and remind them to bump the version in the DESCRIPTION file.
