### Claim a Vignette to Convert

1. Check the
   [Sweave2rmd Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/Bioconductor/projects/2/views/1)
2. Select an issue to work on by setting `Status` to `Todo`, `Last Modified` to
   today, and change `Assigned` to your GitHub username.
3. If the package is not maintained by Bioconductor, you must contact the
   maintainer to verify they will accept a pull request with the converted
   vignette.

### Confirm Willingness of Maintainer to Accept Pull Request

#### Contact the Maintainer via a GitHub Issue

1. Search for the package on
[BiocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html#___Software).
2. Click on the package name to go to the package's landing page.
3. Under `Details`, find the `URL` to the package's repository.
4. Open an issue asking if they would accept a pull request with the converted
   vignette. You can modify the following example to post on the issue.
   ```
   Hi,

   I'm volunteering with [Sweave2Rmd](https://github.com/Bioconductor/sweave2rmd)
   and we're trying to replace all Bioconductor Sweave vignettes R Markdown
   vignettes. Would you be willing to accept a pull request with the R Markdown
   version of __vignette_name__ from one of our volunteers? We'll ask you to
   review and accept the pull request. You'll also need to bump the version
   number in your DESCRIPTION file so that the build machines will recognize
   that a new version is available.

   Thanks for your time.
   ```

#### Contact the Maintainer via Email

1. Search for the package on
[BiocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html#___Software).
2. Click on the package name to go to the package's landing page.
3. Find the maintainer's email.
4. Email the maintainer asking if they would accept a pull request with the
   converted vignette. You can modify the following example email to send to
   the maintainer:
   ```
   Hi,

   I'm volunteering with [Sweave2Rmd](https://github.com/Bioconductor/sweave2rmd)
   and we're trying to replace all Bioconductor Sweave vignettes with R Markdown
   vignettes. Would you be willing to accept a pull request converting
   __vignette_name__ for __package_name__ from one of our volunteers? We'll ask
   you to review and accept the pull request. You'll also need to bump the
   version number in your DESCRIPTION file so that the build machines will
   recognize that a new version is available.

   Thanks for your time.
   ```

After you contact the maintainer, set the `Status` to `Contacted` and
`Last Modified` to today.

Once you hear back from the maintainer, if they will accept the pull request,
set the `Status` to `Maintainer Interested`. If they will not accept a pull
request, set it to `Maintainer Not Interested`. If after two weeks, the
maintainer is not responsive, set the `Status` to `Unresponsive` and update
`Last Modified` to today's date.

### Create the R Markdown (.Rmd) vignette and Remove the Sweave vignette (.Rnw) 

Note: We use `file` to indicate the name of the Sweave file that we will
replace with an `.Rmd` file.

1. On the project board, select a vignette and set the `Status` to `In Progress`.
   Also, write your GitHub username under `Assigned` and set `Last Modified` to
   today.
2. Search for the package on
   [BiocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html#___Software).
3. Click on the package to visit its landing page.
4. Under `Documentation`, find PDF of the vignette you selected in step 1. You
   can see the name of the PDF by inspecting its URL. Use the content of the
   PDF as your guide when you create the R Markdown file. The content of the
   HTML generated by knitting the R Markdown file should closely match the
   contents of the PDF.
5. Under `Details`, find the `URL` to the repository.
6. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
   you will work on.
7. [Clone your newly forked repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
8. Make a branch for your changes: `git switch -c file-Rmd`
9. If `BiocStyle` and `knitr` aren't in the DESCRIPTION file, add them under
   `Suggests`.`
10. Add `VignetteBuilder: knitr` as a new line in the DESCRIPTION file.
11. If agreed with the maintainer, add yourself as a contributor. In the
    DESCRIPTION file, convert the Authors section to conform to the following
    block.

    ```
    Authors@R: c(
        person("First Name", "Last Name", role = "aut"),
        person("First Name", "Last Name", role = "ctb"),
        person("Your First Name", "Your Last Name", role = "ctb",
            comment = "Converted YOUR_VIGNETTE_NAME vignette from Sweave to RMarkdown / HTML."),
        person("Bioconductor Package Maintainer",
            email = "maintainer@bioconductor.org", role = "cre"))
    ```

    The following roles indicate the following
    * "cre" - maintainer
    * "aut" - author 
    * "ctb" - contributor

    Note: that the `Maintainer` in this case is `Bioconductor Package Maintainer`.
    The separate maintainer line has been deleted and moved into the
    `Authors@R`. If you don't remove the separate maintainer line, the package
    will fail to pass on the build report.
12. Commit your changes to your branch. Write a brief and precise commit
    message, such as

    ```
    # Add changes to the file to the commit
    git add DESCRIPTION
    # Create commit with the following message
    git commit -m 'Update DESCRIPTION with BiocStyle, knitr, VignetteBuilder'
    ```
13. If you have `pandoc`, use it to preprocess. In the terminal 

    ```
    pandoc -f latex -t markdown file.Rnw -o file.Rmd
    # Replace file.Rnw and file.Rmd with the name of the vignette you're converting
    ```

    Note: We currently use this method to preprocess files since we can't
    directly convert from Sweave (.Rnw) to R Markdown (.Rmd). `pandoc` has some
    issues processing chunks of code, so we'll have to manually correct these
    sections of the .Rmd file.

14. If the file doesn't have [yaml](https://yaml.org/) at the top, add it using
    the following as an example:

    ```
    ---
    title: "Vignette Title"
    author: Vignette Author
    date: `r format(Sys.Date(), "%B %d, %Y")`
    package: PackageName
    vignette: >
      %\VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette Title}
      %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
      %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
    output:
      BiocStyle::html_document
    ---
    ```

    If the document will need a table of contents, you can alter the `output`
    as follows:

    ```
    output:
      BiocStyle::html_documents
        number_sections: true
        toc: true
        toc_depth: 4
    ```

    Note: Where the date is shown, you want to put the following inline code
    surrounded by backticks, so that it will be updated whenever the vignette
    is compiled:

    ```
    r format(Sys.Date(), "%B %d, %Y")
    ```

15. If agreed with the maintainer, add yourself as a contributor:

    ```
    ---
    title: "Vignette Title"
    author:
      - name: Vignette Author
        affiliation: Vignette Author's Institution
      - name: Your Name
        affiliation: "Vignette translation from Sweave to R Markdown / HTML"
    date: `r format(Sys.Date(), "%B %d, %Y")`
    package: PackageName
    vignette: >
      %\VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette Title}
      %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
      %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
    output:
      BiocStyle::html_document
    ---
    ```

    Note: Using `affiliation` to give attribution is a hack; however, when
    you knit the .Rmd, it will display your name and only the value of
    `affiliation`.

16. Convert any lines manually as necessary.
17. If using RStudio, `Knit` your new vignette and compare with the Sweave
    version periodically to ensure that the HTML produced from your R Markdown
    file is representative of the PDF you found in step 4.
18. Repeat 16-17 until your new `HTML` vignettes accurately represents the
    Sweave version. Note: If you get stuck or run into an error, ask for help
    on the #sweave2rmd channel on the [Bioconductor Community Slack](https://community-bioc.slack.com).
    Provide any helpful information, including error messages, the vignette and
    the package you're working on.
19. Add and commit your changes to your branch

    ```
    git add file.Rmd
    git commit -m 'Convert file to Rmd'
    ```

20. Remove the Sweave file with `git rm file.Rnw` and commit the change with
    `git commit -m 'Remove file.Rnw'`.
21. [Push your branch](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push) back to GitHub
    with `git push origin file-rmd`.
22. On github.com, go to your forked repository and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
23. In the comments of the pull request, ask for a review from
    `@Bioconductor/sweave2rmd` and attach the PDF and HTML vignettes. If you
    opened an issue to communicate with the maintainer, you can automatically
    link the pull request and the set the issue to be closed upon merge by add
    the word "close" and the number of the issue in the comments--e.g.,
    `close #192` to close issue #192.
24. On the project board, set the `Status` to `PR Needs Review` and update `Last
    Modified`.
25. Give us time to review your pull request.
26. If your reviewer or the maintainer leaves any comments, address them until
    your pull request is ready to merge. Repeating 14-17 and 19 as necessary.

### Review a Pull Request

When reviewing a pull request, confirm

* the `.Rmd` file knits to `HTML`
  Note: The best way to check is to `R CMD build` the package then check for
  the html in the tarball. This is how it is built on the Bioconductor build
  system. If you only knit the file, RStudio's knitter will knit regardless of
  errors in the `DESCRIPTION` file.

  For example, where the package is `GenomicAlignments` and the vignette is
  `WorkingWithAlignedNucleotides.Rmd`:
  ```
  $ # Build the package
  $ R CMD build GenomicAlignments
  * checking for file ‘GenomicAlignments/DESCRIPTION’ ... OK
  * preparing ‘GenomicAlignments’:
  * checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK
  * cleaning src
  * installing the package to build vignettes
  * creating vignettes ... OK
  * cleaning src
  * checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts
  * checking for empty or unneeded directories
  * building ‘GenomicAlignments_1.33.1.tar.gz’
  
  $ # Check the tarball for the html
  $ tar ztf GenomicAlignments_1.33.1.tar.gz | grep 'doc/WorkingWithAlignedNucleotides'
  GenomicAlignments/inst/doc/WorkingWithAlignedNucleotides.R
  GenomicAlignments/inst/doc/WorkingWithAlignedNucleotides.Rmd
  GenomicAlignments/inst/doc/WorkingWithAlignedNucleotides.html
  ```
* the `.Rnw` file has been removed
* in the `DESCRIPTION` file
  * `BiocStyle` and `knitr` are included in `Suggests`
  * the line `VignetteBuilder: knitr` exists
  * any additional lines use the same spacing and indents as the existing
    document
* if agreed with the Maintainer,
  * in the `.Rmd` file, the contributor is in the Author list in
    the yaml. They can be added with the `affliation` hack to specify that
    they performed the conversion from Sweave to R Markdown.
  * in the `DESCRIPTION` file, the contributor is in `Authors@R`
    with `role="ctb"` and a `comment` that they converted or translated the
    Sweave document to R Markdown. If the contributor converted more than one,
    the comment can be generalized to reduce the listing of separate vignettes.
    For example, `person("First Name", "Last Name", role="ctb",
    comment="'Title' vignette translation from Sweave to Rmarkdown / HTML")`
    and `person("First Name", "Last Name", role="ctb",
    comment="Vignette translations from Sweave to Rmarkdown / HTML")`.
  * if this pull request includes a conversion from using the separate `Author`
    and `Maintainer` lines into the `Authors@R` vector, check that the
    `Authors@R` vector includes the maintainer as specified with `role='cre'`.
    Note: the separate `Maintainer` line should be completely removed.
* the `HTML` document is representative of the `PDF` in content and
  in general the presentation
* the R Markdown file is representative of the Sweave document and follows best
  practices, such as replacing links to Bioconductor packages with calls to
  BiocStyle's `Biocpkg()`
* Following [Bioconductor Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer
  Review](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/general.html) the package
  passes `R CMD build` and `R CMD check` with no errors 
* Only files necessary for the conversion are included in the pull request.
  See the [Bioconductor Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/gitignore.html?q=.gitig#gitignore)
  for more information.
* Code blocks are surrounded by a blank line, and there are no blank lines
  before the start or after the end of the code within the code block.
  
  For example, you can see the formatting of code blocks below:
````markdown
  # Examples of Code Block Formatting

  You can see here in this example that we have a single space before and after
  every code chunk, section, or paragraph. Also, you will notice that there are no
  blank lines before the start or after the end of the code within the code block.

  `r ''````{r quick_start-load, results="hide", message=FALSE}
  library(GenomicFiles)
  ```

  Ranges can be a `GRanges`, `GRangesList` or `GenomicFiles` class.

  `r ''````{r quick_start-ranges}
  gr <- GRanges("chr14", IRanges(c(19411500 + (1:5)*20), width=10))
  ```
````
* Long lines have been broken up and reformatted, you can achieve this by
  selecting the text in your script and then clicking on `Code > Reflow Comment`
  in R Studio. It will automatically reformat your script and text

Here's a checklist you can use with the pull request:

```
- [ ] the `.Rmd` file knits to `HTML`
- [ ] `R CMD build` runs without errors or timeouts
- [ ] the tarball from `R CMD build` contains the `HTML` (check with the
  following by substituting the package name and vignette name `tar ztf
  package_name.tar.gz | grep 'doc/vignette_name'`)
- [ ] the `.Rnw` file has been removed
- [ ] in the `DESCRIPTION`, `BiocStyle` and `knitr` are listed in `Suggests`
- [ ] in the `DESCRIPITON`, the line `VignetteBuilder: knitr` exists
- [ ] any added lines use the same spacing and indents as the existing
  document
- [ ] if agreed with the Maintainer, the contributor is in the author list
  in the `DESCRIPTION` file; refer to the contribution guide for acceptable
  formats
- [ ] if agreed with the Maintainer, the contributor is in the author list
  in the vignette's YAML; refer to the contribution guide for acceptable formats
- [ ] If this pull request involves converting from separate `Author` and 
  `Maintainer` lines to the `Authors@R` vector, ensure that the `Authors@R`
  vector includes the maintainer as specified with `role='cre'`, and remove
  the `Maintainer` line entirely.
- [ ] `HTML` document is representative of the `PDF` in content and
  in general the presentation
- [ ] Where the contributor was not able to preserve the content and presentation
  of the `PDF` is noted as a comment in the pull request
- [ ] the R Markdown file is representative of the Sweave document and follows
  best practices, such as replacing links to Bioconductor packages with calls
  to BiocStyle's `Biocpkg()`
- [ ] Only files necessary for the conversion are included in the pull request.
- [ ] Long lines have been broken up and reformatted, you can achieve this by
  selecting the text in your script and then clicking on `Code > Reflow Comment`
  in R Studio.
- [ ] Code blocks are surrounded by a blank line, and there are no blank lines
  before the start or after the end of the code within the code block. 
```

Use the comments to communicate issues to resolve for the volunteer who made
the pull request.

When all issues are resolved, ask the maintainer to approve the pull request
and remind them to bump the version in the `DESCRIPTION` file and push to
Bioconductor.
