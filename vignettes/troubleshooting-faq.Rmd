*Purpose: This document compliments Sweave2Rmd [Contribute](https://bioconductor.github.io/sweave2rmd/articles/contribute.html) 
page. It is a FAQ inventory for common issues you may run into during the 
document conversion process. For more context on the project, see the 
[Sweave2Rmd project page](https://bioconductor.github.io/sweave2rmd/index.html).* 

## Common Questions: 

### *Question:* Can I Add a Footnote in the YAML title or author fields? 

*Answer:* Ordinarily, footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret.
e.g., `^[This is a footnote.]`. However, due to a bug, footnotes in the YAML 
title or author fields no longer run. If attempted, you will receive a a LaTeX 
error. If you are converting a vignette and notice that the author byline 
includes a footnote, as does the Bioconductor vignette [Random Numbers in BiocParallel](https://docplayer.net/228745333-Random-numbers-in-biocparallel.html), 
there is a work around. In the YAML, add three drop down lines for the author. 
Include all or a combination of the following: name, affiliation, and email. See
below. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
author:
  name: Martin Morgan
  affiliation: Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY
  email: https://www.roswellpark.org/martin-morgan
``` 

### *Question:* How can I handle duplicate chunk names?
*Background info*: When working with R markdown files, duplicate code chunk
names tend to prevent knitting and may cause `BiocCheck` to fail.

*Answer*: Look for the exact duplicate code chunk names and rename them. For
example if the duplicate code chunk name is `example` you can rename the other
chunk name to `example1` or `example_` as long as it does not change the meaning
or make it hard for someone to understand the code. If you do not understand the
code or document well, always ask the maintainer or reviewers for what to do.

### *Question:* Having problem while checking `R CMD build` contains the `HTML`?
*Background info*: While converting a Sweave vignette to R markdown vignette sometimes
 we face problem while doing R CMD check using 
 `tar ztf package_name.tar.gz | grep 'doc/vignette_name'` even after the R CMD build
 runs succesfully without any errors or timeouts this could happen if we missed some important lines 
 in YAML header.

 *Answer*: Look for the file which is actually problematic try to run 
 `tar ztf package_name.tar.gz | grep doc` in your package terminal if it still
 does not build the PDF or the html file try removing your `.Rmd` file and add
 `.Rnw` file if it build the PDF that means you have problem in your .Rmd file
 one of the possible solution of the problem might be that your
 `%\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}` line is missing in the YAML header, you can try to add 
 `%\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}` line in YAML header
 and again run `R CMD build` and `R CMD check` this happens because the YAML header plays very
 important role in the conversion
 process, The first few lines of the vignette contain important 
 [metadata](https://r-pkgs.org/vignettes.html#metadata)
 you can refer for more information regarding YAML header. If you do not understand the 
 code or [contubute](https://bioconductor.github.io/sweave2rmd/articles/contribute.html) 
 document well, always ask the maintainer or reviewers for what to do.
